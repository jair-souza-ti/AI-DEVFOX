The AI DEVFOX project emerged from the need to explore accessible and free "no code" tools, 
aiming at ease of maintenance and low cost for both developers and clients. A notable advantage 
of these tools, such as Google Sites, is the speed in creating medium-sized websites, saving 
weeks of work. Although more complex customization requires intervention in the code, Google 
Sites offers a simplified option for most clients seeking quick and simple solutions.
